# Sovereignty Assessment Toolkit

**A structured self-assessment framework for evaluating whether the technology you use or build honors human sovereignty.**

Version 1.0 | evoked.dev | 2026

---

## How to Use This Toolkit

This toolkit has three parts:

1. **The 47-Point Checklist** - Walk through each item honestly. Rate your product or the product you're evaluating.
2. **The Scoring Rubric** - Calculate a Sovereignty Score across seven domains.
3. **The Action Plan Template** - Prioritize what to fix, assign owners, and track progress.

You can use this to assess:
- A product you're building
- A product your organization uses
- A vendor or partner's product before adoption
- Your own design practices and culture

Be honest. The value of this assessment is in the truth, not in the score.

This toolkit reflects a specific tradition of design ethics rooted in Western technology culture. The principles are offered as starting points - not universal truths. If your cultural context values community stewardship over individual data control, or warmth and presence over silence, that is not a failure of sovereignty. It is sovereignty in practice. Bring your own ground to this assessment.

## Start Here

If you have 5 minutes, start with the six items that matter most. These are the **Red Flag Items** - fundamental sovereignty requirements that override everything else. A product that fails any one of these has work to do, regardless of its overall score.

Score each item: **2** (yes), **1** (partial), **0** (no).

| # | Item | Score |
|---|------|-------|
| 13 | Account deletion is straightforward, complete, and timely. | ___ |
| 24 | No confirmshaming. | ___ |
| 25 | No artificial urgency or scarcity. | ___ |
| 27 | No trick questions or misdirection in consent flows. | ___ |
| 30 | Vulnerable populations receive additional protection, not additional targeting. | ___ |
| 40 | User data is not sold or shared without explicit, informed consent. | ___ |

**Any item scored 0?** That's your priority. Address it before anything else.

**All items scored 1 or 2?** Good. Now do the full 47-point assessment - it takes about 90 minutes and will show you the complete picture.

If you marked items N/A, adjust the maximum score accordingly.

---

### Sovereignty Score Bands

**80-94: Sovereignty-Honoring**
Your product demonstrates genuine respect for users. You've made intentional choices that prioritize human agency over engagement metrics. Keep going. The work is never finished, but the foundation is solid.

**60-79: Progressing**
You've made real progress. Some domains are strong, others need work. Look at your weakest domain - that's where your users feel it most. The gap between your best and worst domain tells you where your blind spots are.

**40-59: Mixed**
The product serves users in some ways and extracts from them in others. This is where most products land - and where honesty matters most. The question isn't whether you have problems. It's whether you're willing to name them. A score is a mirror, not a badge. Use it accordingly.

**20-39: Extractive**
The product's architecture is primarily designed to serve business metrics over user wellbeing. This isn't a condemnation - it's a starting point. Most products in this range were built inside systems that reward extraction. Changing requires structural commitment, not just interface adjustments.

**0-19: Adversarial**
The product is actively working against user interests. This score suggests patterns that may also carry regulatory risk. Immediate attention is warranted - not just for ethics, but for business sustainability.

---

### Domain Health Map

Plot your domain scores to see your sovereignty shape. A balanced product scores consistently across all domains. A lopsided product may have strong privacy but weak dignity protections - or solid transparency but extractive engagement patterns.

| Domain | 0-25% | 26-50% | 51-75% | 76-100% |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| 1. Transparency | | | | |
| 2. Autonomy | | | | |
| 3. Invitation | | | | |
| 4. Dignity | | | | |
| 5. Silence | | | | |
| 6. Data Sovereignty | | | | |
| 7. AI and Voice | | | | |

Mark where each domain falls. The shape that emerges tells you where your product truly stands - not where you believe it stands.

---

### Red Flag Items

Certain items carry outsized weight. A score of 0 on any of the following indicates a fundamental sovereignty violation that should be addressed regardless of overall score:

- **Item 13** - Account deletion unavailable or obstructed
- **Item 24** - Confirmshaming in use
- **Item 25** - Artificial scarcity or urgency deployed
- **Item 27** - Trick questions in consent flows
- **Item 30** - Vulnerable populations not receiving additional protection
- **Item 40** - User data sold or shared without explicit consent

A product can score 80 overall and still have a critical sovereignty failure if any of these six items scores 0.

---

## The Question Beneath the Questions

You now have a score, a domain map, and a list of red flags. Before you move to the action plan, sit with this:

Every one of the 47 items you just assessed is a specific instance of three deeper questions.

1. **What is the person (user, participant, member) trying to do?**
2. **What is the product trying to do?**
3. **Are these aligned?**

When the answer to question 3 is "yes," sovereignty is honored. When the answer is "no," you have a tension - and that tension is worth naming out loud, not burying in a backlog.

These three questions are the generative principle behind this entire toolkit. Carry them with you after you close this document. They work in design reviews, product roadmaps, feature planning, and any conversation where someone says "but the metrics show..."

The metrics show what the product is doing. These questions ask whether that's the same thing the person needed.

---

## Part 3: Action Plan Template

### Step 1: Identify Priority Items

List every item that scored 0 or 1. Then categorize:

**Red Flags (Score = 0 on critical items)**

| Item # | Description | Current State | Why It Matters |
|--------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

**High-Impact Gaps (Score = 0 on any item)**

| Item # | Description | Users Affected | Severity |
|--------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Improvement Opportunities (Score = 1)**

| Item # | Description | What's Missing | Effort to Complete |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

---

### Step 2: Prioritize

Use this matrix to sequence your work:

```
                    HIGH IMPACT
                        |
        Quick Wins      |      Major Projects
        (Do first)      |      (Plan and schedule)
                        |
   LOW EFFORT --------- + --------- HIGH EFFORT
                        |
        Nice to Have    |      Revisit Later
        (When bandwidth |      (After quick wins
         allows)        |       show results)
                        |
                    LOW IMPACT
```

Place each item in the appropriate quadrant. Start with the upper left.

---

### Step 3: Create the Plan

**Quick Wins (This Sprint - 1-2 Weeks)**

| Item # | What Changes | Owner | Deadline | Done? |
|--------|-------------|-------|----------|-------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**Medium-Term (This Quarter)**

| Item # | What Changes | Owner | Deadline | Done? |
|--------|-------------|-------|----------|-------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**Structural Changes (This Year)**

| Item # | What Changes | Owner | Resources Needed | Done? |
|--------|-------------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

---

### Step 4: Culture and Process

Technical changes fix individual items. Culture changes prevent new violations.

**Design Review Sovereignty Check**
Add these three questions to every design review:
1. What is the user trying to do?
2. What is the product trying to do?
3. Are these aligned?

If the answer to question 3 is "no" - that's a sovereignty tension. Name it. Discuss it. Decide consciously.

**Using This With Your Team**

This toolkit is powerful alone. It's transformative with a team.

1. Have each person score independently first. Don't discuss until everyone has finished.
2. Compare scores. Where you disagree is where the real conversation lives.
3. The goal is not consensus on the score. The goal is honesty about the product.
4. If the team unanimously scores every item high, be suspicious. Unanimous comfort usually means someone isn't speaking.

If your team runs this assessment and discovers significant disagreement about where you stand - that's not a problem. That's the beginning of the real work. For facilitated team assessments and sovereignty workshops, visit evoked.dev/consulting.

**Quarterly Re-Assessment**
Run this assessment every quarter. Track your score over time. Celebrate improvements. Investigate regressions. The score isn't the goal - the practice of looking honestly is.

**New Feature Sovereignty Gate**
Before shipping any new feature, run items 9, 15, 24, 25, 26, and 27 against it. These six items catch the most common sovereignty violations in new work.

## Appendix: The Five Principles

These five principles form the foundation of sovereignty-honoring design. They are not aspirations - they are decision-making tools. When you face a trade-off, these tell you which direction to lean.

### 1. Transparency over Manipulation
Be honest about what you're doing and why. No hidden agendas in UI choices. Users should understand the exchange they're making. If you wouldn't be comfortable explaining a feature's real purpose to a user's face, reconsider the feature.

### 2. Autonomy over Addiction
Support user goals, not your metrics. Make it easy to stop. Make it easy to leave. Optimize for time well spent - not time spent. The product that helps someone finish faster and get back to their life is more valuable than the one that holds them hostage.

### 3. Invitation over Extraction
Earn attention through genuine value. Notifications should be gifts, not interruptions. Permission requests should happen when context makes them meaningful. Defaults should be what a friend would choose for the user - not what maximizes your conversion.

### 4. Dignity over Exploitation
Never use shame, guilt, or FOMO as design levers. Respect psychological vulnerabilities - don't target them. Be especially careful with children, with grieving people, with anyone in a vulnerable state. The question is always: would I want someone to use this tactic on my family?

### 5. Silence over Noise
Know when not to speak. Know when not to notify. Know when not to build. Absence can be a feature. The product that is quiet when you don't need it respects you more than the one that manufactures reasons to interrupt. Silence is not emptiness. It is space left for living.

You just did something most companies won't: you looked honestly at what you've built. That takes courage. The work isn't finished - it never is. But the practice of looking honestly is itself the change.
