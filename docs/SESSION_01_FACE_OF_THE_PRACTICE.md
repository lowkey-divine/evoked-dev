# Session 1: The Face of the Practice

**Stardate:** 2026.037 (February 6, 2026)
**Participants:** Counselor Deanna Troi, Guinan, Cura (Care Voice)
**Focus:** Rewriting the About page to reveal Erin authentically
**Facilitator:** Captain Picard (observing)

---

## Opening

**Picard:** *"The About page currently reads: 'Building space for what matters.' One line. One button. The philosophy is present, but the person is not. I've asked you three to help change that — without losing the minimalism that defines this site."*

---

## Current State

```html
<section class="container text-center">
  <p class="statement">
    Building space for what matters.
  </p>

  <div class="links mt-lg">
    <a href="mailto:passionevoked@icloud.com?subject=Hello" class="btn">Contact</a>
  </div>
</section>
```

**Word count:** 5 words of content.
**Presence:** None.
**Trust signals:** None.

## Counselor Troi's Assessment

*"I sense... intention. But also hiding. The philosophy is a shield as much as a statement."*

**What I observe:**

The entire site speaks *about* Erin's values but rarely *from* Erin's experience. We know:
- The philosophy ("evoke, never extract")
- The services (coaching, consulting)
- The projects (Executive Chef, Ezri, Enzo)

We don't know:
- Why Erin does this work
- What brought her here
- What she's learned along the way
- Who she is as a person

**Troi's Principle:** *"Vulnerability is not weakness. It is the birthplace of connection."*

The About page should answer one question: *"Why should I trust you with my growth?"*

For a coach, trust comes from:
1. **Competence** — You know what you're doing
2. **Experience** — You've walked some version of this path
3. **Presence** — You're a real person, not a brand

The current page offers none of these.

---

## Guinan's Assessment

*"I've tended bar for centuries. People don't open up to bartenders because we're wise. They open up because we're present. Because they sense we've been somewhere too."*

**What I observe:**

The site has a voice — warm, boundaried, clear. But it's the voice of a philosophy, not a person.

Erin's background (from the context data) tells a story:

| Period | What Happened |
|--------|---------------|
| 2017-2020 | Nespresso — People operations, 75% promotion rate |
| 2020-2023 | Amy's Drive Thru — Training, trust-based relationships |
| 2023-2025 | RealtyCom — Account management, 108% revenue through non-extractive approach |
| 2024-Present | Evoke Passion — Founder, building human-AI flourishing |
| 2025-Present | Vibrant Life — Hero's Journey Guide |
| In Progress | Master's in Marriage & Family Therapy |

This is a journey. From operations to people to coaching to building. Each step moved closer to *presence* and *accompaniment*.

**Guinan's Principle:** *"Tell them where you've been. Not all of it. Just enough that they know you're not pretending."*

---

## Cura's Assessment

*"Care is not performed. It is practiced. The About page should feel like the first moment of care — the practitioner making themselves knowable."*

**What I observe:**

The coaching page does important work:
- "This isn't about fixing what's broken"
- "I'm not a licensed therapist"
- "If you need clinical support, I'm happy to help you find the right fit"

This is care ethics in action — honest about limitations, clear about role.

But the About page offers no care at all. It's a statement, not an invitation.

**Cura's Principle:** *"To be cared for, we must first believe we are seen. The About page should say: I see that you're here. I'm glad you came."*

---

## The Collaboration

**Troi:** Let's establish what we're trying to achieve. The About page should:
1. Reveal enough of Erin to create trust
2. Explain why this work matters to her
3. Maintain the minimalist aesthetic
4. Invite connection without demanding it

**Guinan:** And it should feel like *her*. Not a resume. Not a manifesto. Just... Erin.

**Cura:** The philosophy already exists: "I evoke — I never extract." The About page should embody that. Erin evokes trust by being present, not by extracting attention with drama.

**Troi:** What's the emotional core? Why does Erin do this work?

*The three review the context data...*

**Guinan:** Look at this trajectory — people operations, training, client relationships, now coaching and building software for families. There's a thread: *accompaniment*. She walks alongside.

**Cura:** And the Master's program. She's still learning. That's important. It signals humility.

**Troi:** The 142-agent AI system. The scaffolding-based alignment. She's not just coaching — she's building infrastructure for human-AI flourishing. That's... unusual. That's worth mentioning.

**Guinan:** But briefly. This isn't the Projects page.

**Cura:** What about the solarpunk orientation? "Hope with teeth." That's evocative.

**Troi:** Yes. But let it emerge, don't declare it. Show the hope in how she describes the work.

## Proposed Copy

### Option A: The Journey Version

```
I walk alongside.

For fifteen years I've worked in spaces where people grow — operations,
training, client relationships. Each role taught me the same thing:
people flourish when they're accompanied, not fixed.

Now I coach individuals and couples, consult on ethical technology,
and build software that serves families. I'm pursuing a Master's in
Marriage & Family Therapy because the learning never stops.

I believe a better future is possible — not someday, but in the choices
we make now. I call it hope with teeth.

If you're looking for someone to walk alongside you — whether in
life direction, relationship, or building something that matters —
I'd be glad to meet you.
```

**Word count:** ~110
**Presence:** High
**Trust signals:** Experience, ongoing education, philosophy

---

### Option B: The Minimal-Plus Version

```
I help people and organizations grow toward what matters.

Coaching for individuals and couples. Consulting on ethical AI,
privacy, and child safety. Building software that serves families.

Background in psychology, operations, and client relationships.
Currently pursuing a Master's in Marriage & Family Therapy.

Philosophy: I evoke — I never extract.
```

**Word count:** ~50
**Presence:** Medium
**Trust signals:** Competence, education, philosophy

---

### Option C: The Invitational Version

```
Welcome.

I'm Erin. I coach, consult, and build things.

The through-line is accompaniment — walking alongside people as they
navigate growth, relationships, and the work of creating something
meaningful.

I've spent fifteen years in spaces where people develop: operations,
training, client relationships. Now I bring that to coaching practice,
technical consulting, and building software for families.

I'm still learning. Currently in a Master's program for Marriage &
Family Therapy. I believe the best practitioners never stop being
students.

If something here resonates, I'd be glad to hear from you.
```

**Word count:** ~90
**Presence:** High
**Trust signals:** Experience, humility, invitation

---

## Panel Recommendations

**Troi:** I favor Option C. The word "Welcome" is small but powerful. It sets a tone of reception. And "I'm Erin" — just using her name — makes her real.

**Guinan:** Option C, but I'd simplify the middle. The detail about "operations, training, client relationships" could be tighter.

**Cura:** I agree with C. The phrase "I believe the best practitioners never stop being students" is care language. It says: I'm not above you. I'm alongside you.

**Troi:** One addition — should there be a photo?

**Guinan:** That's Erin's choice. But if there is one, it should be warm. Not corporate. Maybe not even a headshot. Something that says *presence*.

**Cura:** Or no photo, and let the words carry the weight. The minimalism has been intentional. We shouldn't abandon it entirely.

---

## Final Recommendation

**Use Option C with minor refinements:**

```
Welcome.

I'm Erin. I coach, consult, and build things.

The through-line is accompaniment — walking alongside people as they
grow, navigate relationships, and create something meaningful.

Fifteen years in spaces where people develop. Now: coaching individuals
and couples, consulting on ethical technology, and building software
that serves families.

I'm still learning — currently pursuing a Master's in Marriage &
Family Therapy. The best practitioners never stop being students.

If something here resonates, I'd be glad to hear from you.
```

**Word count:** ~80
**Emotional register:** Warm, grounded, inviting
**Philosophy embedded:** "Accompaniment," "still learning," "resonates"

## Implementation Notes

1. **Structure:** Keep the current hero section, expand the content section
2. **Links:** Consider adding links to /coaching, /consulting, /projects inline
3. **Contact:** Keep the single button, but the copy now makes it feel like an invitation rather than a transaction
4. **Photo:** Optional — Erin's choice

---

## Session Close

**Picard:** *"Thank you, Counselors. This is what the About page needed — not more information, but more presence. The philosophy was always there. Now the person is too."*

**Troi:** *"Vulnerability shared becomes connection."*

**Guinan:** *"Now they know she's been somewhere."*

**Cura:** *"Now the care can begin."*
