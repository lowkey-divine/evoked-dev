## Red Flags to Watch

### Underutilization

If they're not using the retainer:
- Check in: "I noticed we haven't connected much — is the retainer working for you?"
- Offer: "Would a different format work better?"
- Consider: Should they pause or cancel?

### Overutilization

If hours are consistently exceeded:
- Surface it: "We're using more than 2 hours/month consistently"
- Offer: "Should we discuss the expanded retainer?"
- Boundary: Don't just absorb the overage

### Scope Creep

If requests are becoming project work:
- Redirect: "That sounds like implementation work — happy to scope that separately"
- Clarify: "The retainer covers advisory, not deliverable creation"
- Offer: "I could do that as a separate engagement"
