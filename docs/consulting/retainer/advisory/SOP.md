# Advisory Retainer — Standard Operating Procedure

**Service:** Advisory Retainer
**Price:** $3,500/month
**Format:** Ongoing advisory relationship
**Commitment:** Month-to-month (3-month minimum recommended)

---

## Overview

This is ongoing access to expertise. Not project work — strategic advice, technical guidance, and a trusted voice when decisions need to be made.

**What's included:**
- Monthly office hours (2 hours scheduled)
- Async access via Slack/Discord
- Priority response (24-hour SLA)
- Review of documents, decisions, designs
- Strategic input on roadmap and direction

**What's NOT included:**
- Writing code (that's implementation)
- Building deliverables (that's project work)
- Production support or on-call
- Unlimited hours (scope is advisory)
- Legal or compliance certification

---

## Who This Is For

### Good Fit

- Teams building products in my areas of expertise
- Leaders who want a sounding board for decisions
- Organizations navigating child safety, privacy, or ethical AI
- Startups without specialized compliance expertise in-house
- Teams who have worked with me before and want ongoing access

### Not a Good Fit

- Need hands-on implementation (offer implementation engagement)
- Need legal advice (refer to legal counsel)
- Need production support (offer different arrangement)
- Can't commit to 3+ months (offer one-time consultation)

---

## Phase 1: Qualification

4. "How would async communication work for your team?"
5. "What's your timeline — when do you need this support?"
6. "Have we worked together before?"

**Assess:**
- Is there genuine ongoing need?
- Are the topics in my areas of expertise?
- Will they actually use the access?
- Is the team set up for async communication?

## Phase 3: Ongoing Delivery

### 3.1 Monthly Rhythm

**Week 1:**
- Invoice sent (1st of month)
- Check in: "What's coming up this month?"

**Weeks 2-3:**
- Office hours as scheduled
- Async support as needed

**Week 4:**
- Month-end reflection
- Any unused office hours — offer to schedule
- Check: Is the retainer working for them?

### 3.2 Office Hours Best Practices

**Before session:**
- Ask for topics/questions in advance
- Review any relevant context
- Prepare thoughts on known topics

**During session:**
- Start with their priorities
- Give direct, actionable input
- Take notes on commitments
- Time-box topics to cover everything

**After session:**
- Send summary of key points
- Any follow-up items noted
- Resources or references mentioned

### 3.3 Async Support Best Practices

**Responding to questions:**
- Acknowledge receipt quickly
- Full response within 24 hours
- Be direct — they're paying for expertise, not hedging
- Flag when something is outside scope

**Document reviews:**
- Clear, specific feedback
- Prioritize comments (critical vs nice-to-have)
- Note what's good, not just what needs work
- Suggest alternatives, not just problems

**Decision support:**
- Ask clarifying questions if needed
- Lay out trade-offs clearly
- Give recommendation with rationale
- Respect that they make final call

### 3.4 Tracking

**Monthly log:**
- Office hours: dates, topics, duration
- Async: questions answered, documents reviewed
- Value delivered: decisions supported, risks identified

**Use for:**
- Monthly summary to client
- Understanding patterns in their needs
- Identifying when scope needs adjustment

---

## Phase 4: Relationship Management

### 4.1 Monthly Check-In

At month end, brief check:
- "Is the retainer working for you?"
- "Are you using the access?"
- "Anything we should adjust?"

### 4.2 Quarterly Review

Every 3 months, offer a deeper check-in:
- What value has the retainer provided?
- What decisions were supported?
- What's coming in the next quarter?
- Should scope expand or change?

### 4.3 Scope Creep Management

**Signs of scope creep:**
- Requests for code writing
- Requests for deliverable creation
- Hours significantly exceeding 2/month
- Requests outside expertise areas

**Response:**
- "That sounds like project work — happy to scope that separately"
- "For that, I'd recommend [alternative]"
- "We're over hours this month — should we discuss expanding scope?"

### 4.4 Upselling (When Appropriate)

If their needs grow, offer:
- Implementation engagement
- Additional retainer hours
- One-time assessment
- Workshop for their team

Only offer when genuinely appropriate to their needs.

## Red Flags

### Client-Side

- Consistently not using the access
- Treating retainer as unlimited consulting
- Expecting implementation work
- Payment delays

### Self-Assessment

- Overcommitting retainer slots
- Scope creeping into project work
- Not providing enough value
- Response times slipping

---

## Notes

- This is a relationship, not a transaction
- Quality over quantity — 2 hours of great input beats 10 hours of mediocre
- If they're not using it, surface that — don't just take the money
- Retainers should lead to referrals and case studies
- Document value delivered — this is how renewals happen
