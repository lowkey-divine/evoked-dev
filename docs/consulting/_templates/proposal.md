## Why Work With Me

I'm not just auditing from a checklist — I've implemented these systems myself.

**What I bring:**
- Hands-on implementation experience (not just theory)
- Technical depth (I read code, not just documentation)
- Practical recommendations (not "hire a lawyer" cop-outs)
- Values alignment (I care about families, not just compliance)
