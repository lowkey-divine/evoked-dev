**Subject:** Checking in — COPPA Review Implementation

---

Hi [NAME],

It's been about a month since I delivered your COPPA Technical Review. I wanted to check in and see how implementation is going.

## Quick Questions

- Have you started on the critical/high priority fixes?
- Any questions that came up during implementation?
- Anything I can help clarify?

## If You're Stuck

If implementation has stalled or you'd like hands-on support, I offer [Child Safety Build Support](https://evoked.dev/consulting) engagements. We work together to implement age gates, consent flows, and data protection — not just audit them.

## If You're Done

If you've implemented the fixes and would like me to verify them, I'm happy to do a quick re-review. Just reply and we can discuss scope.

## Testimonial Request

If the review was valuable, I'd appreciate a brief testimonial I can share with future clients. Just a sentence or two about your experience — no pressure if you'd rather not.

Either way, I hope the review helped you build something families can trust.

Best,
Erin
