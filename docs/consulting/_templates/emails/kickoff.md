Hi [NAME],

Thank you for choosing evoked.dev for your COPPA Technical Review. I'm looking forward to helping you build something families can trust.

## What Happens Next

**1. Complete the intake questionnaire**
Please fill out the attached questionnaire and return it within 2 business days. The more detail you provide, the more targeted my review can be.

**2. Provide codebase access**
I'll need read-only access to your codebase. Options:
- GitHub/GitLab: Add me as a collaborator (username: `[YOUR_GITHUB]`)
- ZIP: Upload to a secure file sharing service and send the link

*Please use a secure method for any credentials — never send passwords in the email body.*

**3. Timeline**
Once I have the questionnaire and code access, I'll begin the review. You can expect:
- **Day 1-2:** Initial review and questions (if any)
- **Day 3-4:** Deep technical assessment
- **Day 5-6:** Report preparation
- **Day 7:** Report delivery

## What You'll Receive

- Comprehensive findings report with severity ratings
- Specific technical recommendations for each finding
- Prioritized implementation roadmap
- 30-minute walkthrough call (optional, included)

## Questions?

Reply to this email anytime. I typically respond within one business day.

Looking forward to working with you.

Best,
