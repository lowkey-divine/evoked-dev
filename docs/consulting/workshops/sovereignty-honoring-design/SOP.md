# Sovereignty-Honoring Design Workshop — Standard Operating Procedure

**Service:** Sovereignty-Honoring Design Workshop
**Price:** $4,000
**Format:** Half-day training (3-4 hours)
**Deliverables:** Live session + recording + framework document + design checklist
**Participants:** Up to 12 (additional participants at extra cost)

## Overview

This workshop teaches teams how to build products that honor user autonomy, avoid dark patterns, and create genuine value rather than extracting attention. It's philosophy + practical application.

**Core principle:** *"We evoke — we never extract."*

## Phase 1: Discovery & Customization (1-2 weeks before)

### 1.1 Discovery Call (30 min)

**Purpose:** Understand their product, team, and what they want to get out of the workshop.

**Questions to ask:**
1. "What does your product do? Who are your users?"
2. "What's your current design philosophy? Is it documented?"
3. "What prompted this workshop? (Specific concerns? Culture shift?)"
4. "Who will attend? (Roles, seniority, design vs. engineering vs. product)"
5. "Are there specific dark patterns you're worried about?"
6. "What does success look like for this workshop?"

**Customization notes:**
- Note their industry (B2B, consumer, family, health, etc.)
- Note their tech stack for examples
- Note specific features they want to examine
- Note their current friction points

## Workshop Content

### Part 1: The Problem (45 min)

**The Attention Economy**
- How products are optimized for engagement over wellbeing
- The metrics that drive dark patterns
- Case studies: social media, gaming, gambling mechanics

**Dark Patterns Taxonomy**
- Deceptive: Fake urgency, hidden costs, misdirection
- Manipulative: Emotional manipulation, social pressure
- Addictive: Variable rewards, infinite scroll, streaks
- Coercive: Difficult cancellation, privacy zuckering

**Why This Matters**
- User trust erosion
- Regulatory pressure (GDPR, FTC, state laws)
- Employee morale and values alignment
- Long-term business sustainability

**Discussion prompt:** "Where have you felt manipulated by a product?"

### Part 2: The Framework (45 min)

**Sovereignty-Honoring Design Principles**

1. **Transparency over Manipulation**
   - Clear about what you're doing and why
   - No hidden agendas in UI choices
   - Users understand the exchange

2. **Autonomy over Addiction**
   - Support user goals, not your metrics
   - Easy exits, not roach motels
   - Time well spent, not time spent

3. **Invitation over Extraction**
   - Earn attention through value
   - Notifications that respect boundaries
   - Defaults that serve users

4. **Dignity over Exploitation**
   - No shame, guilt, or FOMO as levers
   - Respect psychological vulnerabilities
   - Especially careful with children and vulnerable users

5. **Silence over Noise**
   - Know when not to interrupt
   - Less is more
   - Absence can be a feature

**For each principle:**
- Definition and rationale
- Examples (good and bad)
- Questions to ask your team
- How to audit against it

### Part 3: Audit Exercise (45 min)

**Small group exercise:**

1. Take a feature from their product (or a similar product)
2. Walk through user journey
3. At each decision point, ask:
   - What is the user trying to do?
   - What are we trying to do?
   - Are these aligned?
   - What dark patterns are present or tempting?
   - How could we honor sovereignty here?

4. Report back to group

**Provide:** Audit checklist worksheet

### Part 4: Applying to Your Product (45 min)

**Group discussion:**

1. Identify 2-3 features to audit
2. For each feature:
   - Current state
   - Sovereignty concerns
   - Proposed changes
   - Trade-offs and business considerations
   - Who owns this change?

3. Create action plan:
   - Quick wins (next sprint)
   - Medium-term changes (next quarter)
   - Cultural/process changes (ongoing)

## Notes

- This workshop works best with mixed teams (design + engineering + product)
- Senior leadership attendance helps with adoption
- Be honest about trade-offs — don't pretend there's no business cost
- The goal is reflection and tools, not judgment
- Follow up on the framework adoption — culture change takes time
