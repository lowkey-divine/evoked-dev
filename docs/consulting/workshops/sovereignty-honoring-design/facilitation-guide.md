---

## Opening (15 min)

### Welcome (5 min)

**Say:**
> "Welcome everyone. I'm Erin, and I'm excited to spend this morning with you exploring how we can build products that honor the people who use them."

> "Before we dive in, a quick ground rule: there's no judgment here. Every team has made design choices they're not proud of. Every team has business pressures that complicate ethical decisions. We're here to learn and reflect, not to point fingers."

**Start recording** (with consent):
> "I'm going to record this session so you have it for reference. Is everyone okay with that?"

### Introductions (8 min)

**For small groups (<8):**
> "Let's go around. Name, role, and one word for how you're feeling about today."

**For larger groups:**
> "In the chat, drop your name, role, and one word for how you're feeling."

### Objectives (2 min)

**Say:**
> "By the end of today, you'll have:
> - A shared vocabulary for talking about ethical design
> - A practical framework for evaluating decisions
> - Experience auditing a real feature
> - Concrete action items for your product"

## Part 1: The Problem (45 min)

### The Attention Economy (15 min)

**Key points:**
1. Products are optimized for engagement metrics, not user wellbeing
2. "Time spent" became the universal currency
3. This creates perverse incentives

**Case study:** Social media feeds
- Outrage gets engagement
- Algorithms optimize for time, not satisfaction
- Users feel worse but keep scrolling

**Discussion prompt:**
> "What metrics does your team optimize for? How do they influence design decisions?"

*Listen for:* DAU, session length, retention, conversion — note which feel aligned vs. misaligned with user benefit.

### Dark Patterns Taxonomy (20 min)

Walk through each category with examples:

**Deceptive:**
- Fake urgency ("Only 2 left!")
- Hidden costs
- Misdirection
- Confirmshaming

**Manipulative:**
- Emotional manipulation
- Social pressure ("John just bought...")
- Fear of missing out

**Addictive:**
- Variable rewards
- Infinite scroll
- Streaks and loss aversion
- Notifications designed to hook

**Coercive:**
- Roach motels (easy in, hard out)
- Privacy zuckering
- Forced continuity

**Say:**
> "These patterns work. That's the uncomfortable truth. They increase the metrics we measure. The question is: at what cost?"

### Discussion (10 min)

**Prompt:**
> "Think of a time you felt manipulated by a product. What was the pattern? How did it make you feel about the company?"

*Facilitate:* Let 3-4 people share. Note patterns. Bridge to the framework.

**Transition:**
> "We've named the problem. Now let's talk about an alternative."

---

## Part 2: The Framework (45 min)

### Introduce the Framework (5 min)

**Say:**
> "Sovereignty-honoring design starts with a simple question: 'Are we building something that serves the user, or something that exploits them?'"

> "The word 'sovereignty' is intentional. It means recognizing that users are autonomous beings with their own goals, not resources to be extracted."

> "Our tagline at evoked.dev is: 'We evoke — we never extract.' That's the mindset we're cultivating."

### Walk Through Each Principle (30 min)

**For each principle, cover:**
1. What it means (2 min)
2. Good example (1 min)
3. Bad example (1 min)
4. Questions to ask your team (1 min)

---

#### Principle 1: Transparency over Manipulation

**What it means:**
> "Be honest about what you're doing and why. No hidden agendas in UI choices. Users should understand the exchange."

**Good example:**
> "Patreon tells creators exactly how much they'll earn after fees. No surprises."

**Bad example:**
> "Hotel booking sites that add 'resort fees' at checkout."

**Questions:**
- "Would we be comfortable if users could see the logic behind this feature?"
- "Are we hiding anything?"

---

#### Principle 2: Autonomy over Addiction

**What it means:**
> "Support user goals, not your metrics. Make it easy to leave. Optimize for time well spent, not time spent."

**Good example:**
> "YouTube's 'Take a Break' reminders. Netflix's 'Are you still watching?'"

**Bad example:**
> "Infinite scroll with no stopping points. Autoplay everything."

**Questions:**
- "Does this feature help users accomplish their goal, or keep them from it?"
- "How easy is it to stop using this?"

---

#### Principle 3: Invitation over Extraction

**What it means:**
> "Earn attention through value. Notifications should respect boundaries. Defaults should serve users, not you."

**Good example:**
> "Superhuman asks what notifications you actually want on first use."

**Bad example:**
> "Apps that request notification permission before you've even used them."

**Questions:**
- "Would users thank us for this notification?"
- "Are our defaults what a friend would choose for them?"

---

#### Principle 4: Dignity over Exploitation

**What it means:**
> "Don't use shame, guilt, or FOMO as levers. Respect psychological vulnerabilities. Be especially careful with children and vulnerable users."

**Good example:**
> "Headspace encourages missed meditation days: 'Life happens. Come back when you're ready.'"

**Bad example:**
> "Duolingo's guilt-tripping owl. 'You made Duo sad.'"

**Questions:**
- "Are we using negative emotions to drive behavior?"
- "How would a child experience this feature?"

---

#### Principle 5: Silence over Noise

**What it means:**
> "Know when not to interrupt. Less is more. Sometimes the best feature is the one you don't build."

**Good example:**
> "Apple's Focus modes. Do Not Disturb. Screen Time."

**Bad example:**
> "Apps that send push notifications to remind you they exist."

**Questions:**
- "Does the user need to hear from us right now?"
- "What would happen if we sent nothing?"

---

### Discussion (10 min)

**Prompt:**
> "Which of these principles feels most relevant to your product right now? Where do you see the biggest gap?"

*Facilitate:* Let the room discuss. Note themes for Part 4.

---

## BREAK (10 min)

**Say:**
> "Let's take 10 minutes. Stretch, get coffee, use the restroom. Be back at [time]."

---

## Part 3: Audit Exercise (45 min)

### Setup (5 min)

**Say:**
> "Now we're going to practice. We're going to audit a real feature using the framework."

**Divide into groups:**
- Groups of 3-4
- Mix roles if possible (design + eng + product)
- Assign breakout rooms (if remote)

**Assign features:**
- Ideally from their product (if they consented)
- Otherwise, use a well-known product (Spotify, Uber, etc.)

### Exercise (25 min)

**Instructions:**

> "For your assigned feature:
>
> 1. Walk through the user journey. What steps does a user take?
> 2. At each step, ask:
>    - What is the user trying to do?
>    - What is the product trying to do?
>    - Are these aligned?
> 3. Identify any dark patterns or sovereignty violations.
> 4. Propose alternatives that honor sovereignty.
>
> You have 25 minutes. I'll drop into each room to check in."

**Provide:** Audit worksheet (digital or printed)

**In breakout rooms:**
- Check that they're on track
- Ask probing questions
- Note interesting discussions for report-back

### Report Back (15 min)

**Each group:** 3-4 minutes to share:
- Feature they audited
- Key sovereignty concern they found
- Alternative they proposed

**Facilitate:**
- Affirm good insights
- Connect to framework principles
- Note action items

---

## BREAK (10 min)

---

## Part 4: Applying to Your Product (45 min)

### Prioritization (15 min)

**Say:**
> "Based on everything we've discussed, let's identify 2-3 features from YOUR product that deserve attention."

**Facilitate discussion:**
- What came up in the audit exercise?
- What have people been uncomfortable about?
- Where are the quick wins?

**Capture on whiteboard:**
- Feature name
- Sovereignty concern
- Impact (users affected)
- Effort (how hard to fix)

**Prioritize:** High impact, lower effort first

### Action Planning (20 min)

**For each prioritized feature:**

| Question | Capture |
|----------|---------|
| Current state | What's happening now |
| Concern | What's the sovereignty issue |
| Proposed change | What should we do instead |
| Trade-offs | What's the business cost |
| Owner | Who drives this forward |
| Timeline | Quick win / This quarter / Later |

**Be honest about trade-offs:**
> "Some of these changes might hurt metrics. That's real. Let's name it. The question is: what are we willing to accept in service of users?"

### Momentum Plan (10 min)

**Quick wins (this sprint):**
- List specific, small changes
- Assign owners

**Medium-term (this quarter):**
- Larger features to redesign
- Who leads the effort

**Culture/process:**
- How do you keep this alive?
- Regular audits?
- Design review criteria?
- Principles documented?

---

## Closing (20 min)

### Key Takeaways (5 min)

**Say:**
> "Let me reflect back what I heard today..."

Summarize:
- Main concerns that came up
- Key features to address
- Commitments made

### Resources (5 min)

Mention:
- Books: "Hooked" (to understand the problem), "Calm Technology"
- Articles: Dark patterns research, FTC guidance
- Tools: Dark pattern audits, accessibility checkers
- Communities: Ethical design groups

### Keeping Momentum (5 min)

**Suggestions:**
- Add sovereignty check to design review
- Quarterly dark pattern audits
- Share the framework with new hires
- Celebrate wins when you remove a dark pattern

### Q&A (5 min)

**Open floor:**
> "What questions do you have? What's still unclear?"

### Close

**Say:**
> "Thank you for your honesty and engagement today. Building products that honor sovereignty isn't easy — there are real business pressures. But the teams that get this right build deeper trust, stronger brands, and products people actually love."

> "I'll send the recording and materials within 48 hours. I'm available for questions for the next 30 days. And if you want ongoing support, we can talk about advisory options."

> "We evoke — we never extract. Go build something you're proud of."

## After the Session

- [ ] Stop recording
- [ ] Save whiteboard/notes
- [ ] Send thank you in chat
- [ ] Note follow-up items
- [ ] Begin materials preparation

---

## Troubleshooting

### If the group is quiet:
- Use direct questions: "Sarah, what do you think?"
- Use breakout rooms more
- Lower the stakes: "There's no wrong answer"

### If someone is defensive:
- Acknowledge: "You're right, this is hard. Business pressures are real."
- Redirect: "Let's look at it from the user's perspective..."
- Don't argue — invite reflection

### If you're running long:
- Compress Part 3 (skip one group's report-back)
- Shorten Part 4 action planning
- Offer async follow-up for remaining items

### If technology fails:
- Have backup video link ready
- Can run without slides if needed
- Phone in as backup audio
