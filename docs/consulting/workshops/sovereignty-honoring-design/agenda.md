**Small Group Exercise**

Break into groups of 3-4. Each group:

1. Pick a feature (from your product or a similar product)
2. Walk through the user journey
3. At each step, ask:
   - What is the user trying to do?
   - What is the product trying to do?
   - Are these aligned?
   - What dark patterns are present or tempting?
4. Propose sovereignty-honoring alternatives

**Report back:** Each group shares key findings

## Ground Rules

1. **Cameras on** (if remote) — we want to see each other
2. **Phones away** — be present
3. **No judgment** — we're here to learn, not to shame
4. **Honesty welcome** — trade-offs are real, let's discuss them
5. **What happens here, stays here** — create safety for candid conversation
