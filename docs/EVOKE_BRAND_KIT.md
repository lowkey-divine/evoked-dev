## 2. Logo

### The Mark: The Lips
The Evoke lips symbolize voice, expression, and the act of evoking — calling forth what already exists within.

The geometric line work overlaying organic lip shapes represents the intersection of structure (ethics, principles, frameworks) and humanity (warmth, care, lived experience).

### Logo Variants

| Variant | Use Case | Fill | Line Work | Background |
|---------|----------|------|-----------|------------|
| **Primary (Yellow)** | Default — use this first | Golden Yellow `#E5A818` | Navy Blue `#2B2D5B` | White/Light |
| **Reversed (Yellow)** | Dark backgrounds — default | Golden Yellow `#E5A818` | White `#FFFFFF` | Dark/Navy |
| **Special (Orange)** | Highlights, special moments | Coral Orange `#E85D3B` | Navy Blue `#2B2D5B` | White/Light |
| **Special Reversed (Orange)** | Dark bg, special moments | Coral Orange `#E85D3B` | White `#FFFFFF` | Dark/Navy |

### Logo Formats

| Format | Description | Use Case |

| **Icon only** | Lips mark alone | Social avatars, favicons, app icons |
| **Stacked** | Lips mark above wordmark | Presentations, documents, letterheads |

- Don't stretch or distort

## 4. Typography

### Font Selection

**Headings: Lora**
- Balanced serif with soft warmth — approachable yet professional
- Rooted, bookish quality that says "substance here" without being stuffy
- Beautiful italic for taglines and pull quotes
- Available on Google Fonts and Canva

**Body: DM Sans**
- Geometric sans-serif with warmth built into its curves
- Clean and modern without feeling clinical
- Excellent readability at all sizes, great weight range
- Available on Google Fonts and Canva

**Wordmark:** The existing stacked logo uses its own serif in all-caps with generous letter spacing. This remains the logo font — do not substitute.

### Why This Pairing Works for Evoke
- Lora's warmth matches the brand's "care deeply, speak directly" voice
- DM Sans's geometry feels principled and structured — reflects the ethical framework
- Together they say: "We've done the thinking, and we're here to help" — not "We're the experts, listen to us"

## 5. Brand Voice

### Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Level | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Warmth | High (0.85) | Genuine care, never clinical |
| Authority | High (0.80) | Deep expertise, earns trust through substance |
| Formality | Medium (0.50) | Professional but not corporate; human |
| Playfulness | Low-Medium (0.35) | Occasional lightness, never flippant |

### Tone by Context

| Context | Tone |
|---------|------|
| Consulting proposals | Confident, knowledgeable, warm |
| Workshop delivery | Engaging, clear, encouraging |
| Website copy | Inviting, principled, direct |
| Social media | Thoughtful, grounded, occasionally bold |
| Internal docs | Honest, precise, collaborative |

### Voice Principles
1. **Say less, mean more** — Concise over verbose
2. **Earned authority** — Show expertise through substance, not jargon
3. **Warmth without softness** — Care deeply, speak directly
4. **Invite, never lecture** — Even in teaching contexts
5. **Name the hard things** — Transparency is the brand

### Language to Use
- "We believe..." / "We've seen..."
- "Families deserve..." / "Children need..."
- "Sovereignty" / "Flourishing" / "Dignity"
- "We evoke" / "Never extract"

### Language to Avoid
- Corporate jargon ("synergy," "leverage," "scalable solutions")
- Fear-based selling ("You're at risk..." / "Before it's too late...")
- Extraction language ("capture," "harvest," "monetize," "users")
- Hollow buzzwords ("innovative," "best-in-class," "cutting-edge")

- [ ] Orange stacked variant (for special use)
- [ ] Orange reversed variant (for special use on dark)
- [ ] SVG versions of all variants (for scalability)

## 8. Sub-Brand Relationship

### "Powered by Evoke" Badge

Products carry a small "Powered by Evoke" mark:

| Product | Own Mark | Evoke Presence |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| The Kitchen Table | TBD (future) | "Powered by Evoke" footer badge |
| Ezri | TBD (future) | "Powered by Evoke" footer badge |

The parent brand appears but doesn't dominate. Each product has its own visual identity while inheriting Evoke's ethical DNA.
