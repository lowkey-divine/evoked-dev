# MAC Brand Assessment — Logo & Identity Review

**Date:** February 7, 2026
**Team:** Mythic Arts Collective (MAC)
**Status:** Brainstorm captured — working Evoke first

---

## Brand Architecture

| Brand | Type | Relationship | Status |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| **Evoke** | Parent | — | Has lips logo, colors defined. **ACTIVE FOCUS** |
| **The Kitchen Table** | Product | Powered by Evoke | Needs new mark (Executive Chef logos rejected) |
| **Ezri** | Product | Powered by Evoke | Needs mark created from scratch |

---

## Executive Chef Logos Reviewed

Two existing logos were assessed for potential Kitchen Table use:

### Logo A (Circular)
- Knife & fork crossed, chef's hat, garlic, herbs, leaves
- Forest green & brown on cream
- "EXECUTIVE CHEF" wordmark

### Logo B (App Icon)
- Crossed chef's knives, chef's hat, small fork/knife emblem
- Purple & brown metallic with chrome frame
- X marks in corners

---

## MAC Assessment: The Kitchen Table

**Unanimous verdict: Neither logo works.**

### @tessera (Ishka) — Symbol Sculptor
- Crossed knives = professional authority = the hierarchy Ontology Inquiry 1 voted to abandon
- Symbols needed: table, gathering, warmth, circle, hands — not knives
- Logo A's herbs are closer but orbit the knife (authority remains central)
- Logo B is furthest from alignment: chrome, X marks = gaming icon

### @fabula (Kirk) — Archetypal Narrative Designer
- Both logos tell "Hero in the Kitchen" — individual mastery, lone chef
- Kitchen Table story = "Family around the Table" — the gathering IS the hero
- Archetype should be The Hearth, not The Chef

### @lingua (Hoshi Sato) — Voice & Tone
- Voice spec: warmth 0.85, formality 0.35, playfulness 0.60
- Both logos: formality ~0.80, warmth ~0.30 — inverted
- Visual voice should match verbal voice: familiar, approachable

### @limen (Vedek Bareil) — Ritual UX
- Onboarding is initiation into sacred family space — logo should feel like door opening
- These feel like credentials being checked
- Color conflicts: Logo A = retired Forest Sage theme; Logo B = outside color system entirely

### @canor (McCoy) — Sonic Impression
- Logo A sounds like: PBS cooking show intro (pleasant, distant)
- Logo B sounds like: mobile game level-up chime (competitive)
- Kitchen Table should sound like: wooden spoon on pot, laughter, chair pulling out

## Direction: The Kitchen Table (FUTURE)

When we return to this brand:

### What the mark should evoke
- Central image: a table — round or rectangular, inviting approach
- Warmth signals: candlelight, steam, shared plate, sun through window
- Color palette: Harvest Gold `#E5A84B`, Garden Green `#4A9D5B`, Warm Cream `#FDF5E6`
- Typography: between Inter's cleanness and Merriweather's warmth
- Feeling: "Come sit with us" — not "Watch me cook"

### What to avoid
- Knives, chef's hats, professional kitchen equipment
- Metallic/chrome finishes
- All-caps aggressive wordmarks
- Competition/achievement energy

---

## Direction: Ezri (FUTURE)

When we return to this brand:

- "A cosmic mirror with guardrails"
- Inner development, reflective, ethical reasoning, symbolic mapping
- Possible symbols: mirror, stars, inner light, compass, spiral
- Should inherit from Evoke parent palette
- Feeling: introspective, safe, expansive
- **Seed asset:** Original evoked.dev constellation favicon saved at `public/images/constellation-ezri-seed.svg` — gold dots orbiting a center point on dark field. Has the right cosmic/reflective energy.

## Evoke Parent Brand

**See separate working document for active brand kit development.**

### Existing Assets
- Lips logo (exists, Europa has it)
- Colors from logo: Golden Yellow `#E5A818`, Coral Orange `#E85D3B`, Navy Blue `#2B2D5B`, White `#FFFFFF`
- Tagline: "We evoke — we never extract."
- Secondary tagline: "I Evoke."
