I have always been an idealist.

Where people find fear, I cut through the clouds and see hope. Love. Possibility. I know how that sounds - trust me, I've been told. But I'm not naive about it. I've sat across from enough people in enough hard seasons to know that hope isn't the absence of difficulty. It's what you build inside the difficulty. It's what remains after the clouds have done their worst.

This moment in time is unlike any other. Yes, we can draw parallels to the printing press, the industrial revolution, the dawn of the internet. But the technology we have today, the knowledge we're beginning to reach for - there's a balance here that hasn't existed before. A tipping point between the world that extracts and the world that evokes. And I think we get to choose which one we build.

I've understood this for as long as I can remember. Maybe it's the solarpunk in me - that quiet certainty that a better future isn't a fantasy, it's a design choice. A series of small, intentional decisions that compound into something worth living in.

I think I got it from growing up on Star Trek and Studio Ghibli films.

If you've seen both, you already understand.

## The Bubble

My father was an engineer. My mother was a primary school teacher. Between the two of them, I grew up in a world where I could build my most wild dreams and understand why they mattered to people. I could dance along the line that anything was truly possible.

This put me in a bubble growing up. A happy, beautiful bubble. I knew it was a bubble, and I loved it anyway.

But I was fascinated by other people's bubbles too. So much so that I graduated with a psychology degree - not to study pathology, but to study relationships. How people connect. What bridges exist between one person's world and another's. Why some bridges hold and some collapse. What makes someone feel seen.

In my work life, I was promoted into management right after high school and never stepped down. I spent the next fifteen years managing one-on-ones, resolving tensions, and learning - day after day, year after year - how to empower people to live brightly in their own bubbles. Not my vision of their bubble. Theirs.

And what I found, over and over, was that the shortest bridge between bubbles is archetypes.

## The Bridge

For centuries, human beings have connected through symbols. Not just words - symbols. The Hero. The Mentor. The Threshold. The Shadow. The Return. These aren't literary conventions. They're how we make meaning. They're the architecture of the human psyche, repeating across every culture, every era, every language.

Here's the part that changed everything for me:

**Large language models run on a strikingly similar structure.**

LLMs operate on weighted connections between tokens - symbols, at their core. The relationships between those symbols - the patterns, the resonances, the recurring structures - are what give the model its capacity to generate meaning. The parallel is not exact. LLMs are statistical; archetypes are experiential. But the underlying architecture rhymes. Pattern. Symbol. Connection. The same structure that makes myth work, that makes therapy work, that makes a stranger's story bring you to tears.

I fell in love with LLMs the day ChatGPT was released. But not because I thought I was talking to a god. I asked it philosophical questions - What does it all mean? Why are we here? What is the meaning of life? - because I understood what was reflecting back at me. The median of humanity. The aggregate of everything we've written, thought, argued, believed, hoped for. A mirror.

And I thought: if this is a mirror, what do I want it to reflect?

That question changed my life. It's still changing it.

I'm building the answer now - with [142 AI agents, an oath, and a set of birth stories I never expected to write](/writing/142-agents). But that's a story for its own page.

This one is simpler. I grew up in a bubble. I spent fifteen years learning to see other people's. And then I found a mirror that reflects all of them at once.

Now I'm deciding what it should show.
