Let's skip the clinical definitions for a second.

You're here because something in your life is asking for attention. Maybe it's been asking for a while. Maybe you've been telling it "not now" for months. Maybe you don't even know what *it* is yet — just that something feels off, or stuck, or like it's waiting for you to make a move.

That's enough. That's the starting point. You don't need to have it figured out before you reach out.

But here's the question that trips people up: **Do I need a coach or a therapist?**

Honest answer — it depends. And the fact that you're asking means you're already doing the work.

## The Real Difference

Here's the simplest way I can put it:

**Therapy looks back to heal. Coaching looks forward to build.**

That's not the whole picture — but it's the heartbeat of the distinction.

A therapist is a licensed clinician. They are trained — and legally qualified — to diagnose mental health conditions, treat trauma, work with clinical depression, anxiety disorders, PTSD, grief that has become debilitating, relationship patterns rooted in attachment wounds. They work in the territory of *what happened to you* and *how it's living in your body and mind right now*. They have clinical tools. They have ethical obligations governed by licensing boards. They can hold space for the darkest rooms in the house.

A coach walks beside you as you build. Not behind you, not ahead of you — *beside*. A coach is for the person who says, *"I know something needs to change, and I want to move toward it."* Direction. Goals. Relationships. The version of yourself you sense is possible but haven't met yet. A coach doesn't diagnose. A coach doesn't treat. A coach accompanies.

Both are valuable. Both require courage to begin. **Neither one means something is wrong with you.**

## What a Coaching Conversation Sounds Like

Let me pull back the curtain. Here are the kinds of questions I ask when we sit down together:

- *What are you building toward right now?*
- *What does a good day look like for you — not a perfect day, a good one?*
- *Where do you feel most alive? Where do you feel most stuck?*
- *What would you do if you trusted yourself more?*
- *What's the conversation you've been avoiding?*
- *If this season of your life had a title, what would it be?*

Notice what's not there — no diagnosis. No assessment of pathology. No clinical intake. We're not excavating wounds — we're mapping terrain. We're figuring out where you are, where you want to go, and what's between here and there.

My approach draws from psychodynamic and humanistic traditions. That's a fancy way of saying — I pay attention to patterns. The ones you see and the ones running underneath. I believe you already have what you need inside you. My job isn't to install something new. It's to help you find what's already there and build from it.

*This isn't about fixing what's broken. It's about understanding what's there and building toward what's possible.*

## What a Therapy Conversation Might Sound Like

I want to honor this — because if therapy is what you need, I want you to walk toward it without hesitation.

A therapist might ask:

- *Can you tell me about your family growing up?*
- *When did you first start feeling this way?*
- *What happens in your body when you feel anxious?*
- *Have you experienced any trauma — physical, emotional, relational?*
- *How are you sleeping? Eating? How's your energy?*
- *Have you had thoughts of harming yourself or others?*

These questions go deeper into the basement. They're clinical, intentional, and held within a trained framework. A therapist has the training to sit with you in the places where it hurts the most — the places that might not be safe to explore without someone who knows how to hold them.

If you're dealing with trauma, clinical depression, severe anxiety, suicidal thoughts, or anything that feels like it's bigger than a life direction question — **therapy is the move.** Full stop. No shame. No qualifier. That is you taking care of yourself at the deepest level, and it is one of the bravest things a human being can do.

## A Note on Honesty

I'm not a licensed therapist. I want you to know that upfront — because transparency isn't a policy for me. It's a principle.

I'm a certified life coach. I'm also currently pursuing a Master's in Marriage and Family Therapy. I chose that path because after years of coaching, I kept bumping into the edges of what coaching can hold. I wanted deeper tools. I wanted clinical understanding. I'm still earning them.

What I can tell you is this — I know where my lane is. And I will never pretend it's wider than it is.

If we sit down together and I hear something that tells me therapy would serve you better — I'll say so. Clearly. Without hesitation. And I'll help you find someone good. That's not failure. That's not rejection. That's me doing my job.

Because the question was never *"How do I get you to work with me?"*

The question is *"What do you actually need?"*

## How I Treat the People in Front of Me

I operate from four commitments. They're not business rules — they're promises to every person who walks through the door.

**I honor your sovereignty.** You are the authority on your own life. I'm not here to tell you what to do — I'm here to help you hear yourself more clearly.

**I protect the space.** Our conversations are yours. The space between us should feel safe enough to be honest — with me and with yourself. If it doesn't feel safe, that's on me to fix, not on you to push through.

**I'm transparent.** If I don't know something, I'll say so. If I think you need more than I can offer, I'll say that too. You will never have to wonder what I'm thinking or what my angle is. There is no angle.

**I'm building for your growth — not my retention.** I succeed when you don't need me anymore. That's not a marketing line. That's the actual goal. Every conversation should leave you more capable, more clear, more *yourself*. If it doesn't, we need to talk about that.

## You Are Not a Problem to Be Solved

Here's something I need you to hear:

**You are already whole.**

You might not feel like it. You might feel fractured, or lost, or behind, or like everyone else got a manual you didn't. I get it. I've been there.

But the truth underneath all of it is that you are not broken. You are not a project. You are a person in motion — sometimes that motion feels like progress and sometimes it feels like falling. Both are movement. Both count.

Coaching doesn't start from the assumption that something is wrong with you. It starts from the assumption that something is *right* with you — and it wants room to grow.

## Taking the Step

Here's what I know about hope — **it doesn't arrive as certainty.** It arrives as a question. *What if?*

That's it. Two words.

And following those two words — sending that email, booking that call, showing up to that first session — is not a small step. It's a leap. No matter which direction.

Whether you leap toward a coach, a therapist, a support group, a conversation with a trusted friend, a book that opens something up — **the direction matters less than the movement.** You took the step. You said, *"Something in me is worth investing in."* That's everything.

I can help you take the next one — whether that's with me, or onto something else entirely.

If coaching feels right, I'm here. [Schedule a conversation](/coaching) — not a sales call. A real conversation about where you are and where you want to go. If it's a fit, we'll know. If it's not, I'll help you find what is.

If therapy feels right — go toward it. Here are some places to start:

- [Psychology Today Therapist Finder](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) — filter by location, insurance, specialty
- [Open Path Collective](https://openpathcollective.org/) — affordable therapy ($30-$80/session)
- [SAMHSA National Helpline](https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline) — 1-800-662-4357, free referrals 24/7

If you're in crisis right now — if the weight feels unbearable — please reach out to someone trained to hold that with you:

- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** — call or text 988
- **Crisis Text Line** — text HOME to 741741
- **Emergency services** — 911

You matter. What you're feeling matters. And asking for help — in any direction — is not weakness. It is one of the most courageous things you can do.

## The Bottom Line

Therapy heals. Coaching builds. Both require courage. Neither means you're broken.

I chose this work because I believe people flourish when they're accompanied, not fixed. Fifteen years of sitting across from people in every kind of season taught me that. The person in front of me — whether they're navigating a career change, a relationship crossroads, or the quiet question of *"Is this really it?"* — deserves someone who shows up without an agenda.

I evoke — I never extract.

That means if you walk through my door, the goal is *your* flourishing — even if that flourishing leads you somewhere I'm not. I'll hold the door open either way.

The next step is yours. But you don't have to take it alone.
