    <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Food is never just food. The moment you ask a family "what do you eat?"
      you're asking about identity, culture, memory, survival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Executive Chef is built to honor that complexity. Not to optimize your diet
      or gamify your groceries — but to help families plan meals, preserve heritage
      recipes, and eat together.
    </p>

  <section class="container">
    <h2>The Kitchen Table</h2>
    <p>
      We rejected restaurant hierarchy. No "executive chefs" and "line cooks"
      in your family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead: <strong>The Kitchen Table</strong>. Table keepers, planners, members,
      learners, guests. Everyone has a place. Everyone participates according to
      their capacity.
    </p>

  <section class="container">
    <h2>Heritage Ontology</h2>
    <p>
      How do you build software that makes space for what it cannot contain?
    </p>
    <ul class="principles">
      <li><strong>Reverent references, not reductive captures</strong> — Point to meaning, don't contain it</li>
      <li><strong>Fragments are sacred</strong> — Incomplete recipes are welcomed</li>
      <li><strong>Family defines family</strong> — Their words, not our taxonomy</li>
      <li><strong>Build for silence</strong> — The system knows when to be quiet</li>
      <li><strong>Space for shadow</strong> — Complicated heritage has a place</li>
    </ul>
