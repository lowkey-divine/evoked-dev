  <section class="container">
    <h2>Not a Guru. A Mirror.</h2>
    <p>
      Ezri does not teach you who you are. It reflects what's already there
      and gives you room to look. The way a candle flame holds your attention — not
      because it demands anything, but because something in you is ready to be still.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are not deficient. You are not behind. You might be buried — under noise,
      under expectations, under the weight of a world that measures everything and
      reflects nothing. Ezri helps you dig out. And then it gets out of the way.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="container">
    <h2>What Happens Inside</h2>
    <ul class="features">
      <li>A constellation forms from who you already are — no quiz, no assessment, no earning it</li>
      <li>Archetypes show up as characters to talk to — curious, surprising, sometimes funny</li>
      <li>Other people's inner worlds are out there, anonymous, waiting to shift your perspective</li>
      <li>The deeper you go, the more it reveals — not because an algorithm decided, but because you came back</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="container">
    <blockquote>
      The system reflects. It does not direct.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      No progress bars. No streaks. No growth percentages. No notifications
      guilting you for being away. The constellation waits the way a clearing in
      the woods waits. It was here before you arrived.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="container">
    <h2>What It Is Not</h2>
    <p>
      Not a productivity tool. Not a mental health app. Not a social network.
      Not a belief system. Not something you can fail at.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need therapy, you should get therapy — and Ezri will gently say so
      if it senses you might. This is not a replacement for a person who can
      look you in the eye.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="container">
    <h2>What Matters Most</h2>
    <p>
      What you carry away from Ezri matters more than what happens inside it.
      The conversation with your partner that goes differently. The moment at work
      where you catch a pattern you only recognized because an archetype named it.
      The night you look at the actual sky and feel connected to something bigger
      than your own story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every session sends you back to your life. That's the point. This is a clearing
      you visit so you can see more clearly when you leave.
    </p>

  <section class="container note-section">
    <h2>A Note on Inner Work</h2>
    <p>
      Reflection can surface things that are tender, confusing, or difficult.
      That's part of the process — but it's not something to face alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      If at any point you feel overwhelmed, please pause.
      <a href="/resources" class="text-link">Here are some places to find support</a>.

    <p class="privacy-note">
      Your inner world belongs to you. Ezri is designed so your data stays private,
      unanalyzed, and never sold.
